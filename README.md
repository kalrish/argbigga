# argbigga

argbigga is a command-line tool to help automate [Mullvad VPN][1] setups/deployments on Linux.

In Swedish, a «mullvad» is a [mole][2], an appropriate image for a VPN service concerned with privacy.
Meanwhile, «argbigga» stands for «[shrew][3]», the mole's closest relative.
In this spirit, argbigga the command-line tool is a companion to [Mullvad's own][4].
